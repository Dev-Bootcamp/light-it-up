Our app's purpose is to display slideshows and/or media on chromecast, when there is no content playing. It will be user generated and there will be a voting system to keep popular content playing more frequently. Users will have an account and must be logged in to view their content. They can create slidewhows and slides. Slideshows can be public/private and can be integrated into other user's Slideshows and Slides.
